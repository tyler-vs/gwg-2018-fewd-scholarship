# Lesson 11 JavaScript Datatypes and Variables

**Pro-tip** Use the JS console in Chrome to test some of the examples from the lesson.

## Intro to Data Types

What is data and why is it important/useful?

Data can be information.

Data can be used for:

- understanding the world
- make educated decisions
- recognize trends
- inform future decisions

Data and datatypes are the building of programming, they allow organization of information within the program and determine how a program will run.

Example of data:

-  A user's Facebook profile feed.

**Pro-tip**, Be aware and know which data types to use and when it is appropriate to use each type.

### Primitive data types in JavaScript

Primitive data types in JavaScript include:

- numbers
- strings
- booleans
- undefined
- null


## Numbers (data type)

The Number data type includes any positive or negative integer, as well as decimals.

### Arithmetic operations

### Comparing numbers

Comparisons between numbers will either evaluate to true or false and use operators which operate on given operands within the expression.

| --- | --- |
| Operator | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `<` | Less than |
| `>` | Greater than |
| `<=` | Less than or equal to |
| `>=` | Greater than or equal to |
| `==` | Equal to |
| `===` | Strict equal to |
| `!=` | Not equal to |
| --- | --- |

**Pro-tip** Just like the command line of an operating system, the developer tools JS console can redisplay a history of past commands entered by hitting the up arrow on the prompt line.
