## what is documentation?

## what is documentation for? 

documentations is written for humans and exists to help us make sense of the code. 

good documentation allows easy collaboration, especially open source projects.
potential employers.

without documentation

- will need to write internal documentation
- simply not use the library
- figuring out code through debugger
- figuring out code through looking at the source code
- i.e. reverse engineering someone's thought process

## Introduction Into README's

README's are single files, contains relevant information about the other files in a project's directory/repository. README's are usually not as complex as product wiki.

By convention, it is written in all caps so it is easily identifiable.

- https://github.com/zkat/can.viewify
- https://github.com/udacity/create-your-own-adventure

A basic [README template gist](https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2) or [locally](./README-template.md).


## Anatomy of a README

should provide just enough context to get a user up and running with the code.

- title and description
- type of language used
- capture spirit of the project, clear and concisely
- installation
- dependencies
- usage
- essential info
- no assumptions to what the end-user already knows

_No formal standard for README's._

### helpful starter questions when writing README's

Essential and non-essential questions.

1. what steps need to be taken?
2. what should the user already have installed or configured?
3. what might they have a hard time understanding _right away_? 


## Documenting a Growing Codebase

Adding Copyright or License information to a project. See https://choosealicense.com/.

Contributing guidelines, style guides, ect.

"Shield" graphics from third parties. i.e. "code passing"


## Using Markdown Syntax

Some common markdown examples, note the _flavor_ of markdown you are using. If using a service likt Github, then use the GitHub flavored Markdown which includes extras like a TODO list.

```md

# title

## subtitle

...text content...

> blockquote

**bold**


```
