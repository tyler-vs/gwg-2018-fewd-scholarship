## why ARIA?

in this lesson: how to express elements that native HTML5 cannot do alone.

for when instances when native HTML does not cut the accesibility, the following are initiatives for bringing areas where there is an issue:

__WAI__ - Web Accessibility Initiative
__ARIA__ - Accessible Rich Internet Applications

or commonly seen referred to as: __WIA ARIA__.

__ARIA__ works by adding semantic attributes to elements that modify the way the element is translated into the _accessibility tree_.
