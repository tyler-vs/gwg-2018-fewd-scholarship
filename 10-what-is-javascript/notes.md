# 10 What is JavaScript

In 1995 JavaScript was invented to make it easier to add interactive and dynamic components of websites. Nowadays JavaScript has taken on to more complex roles as a programming language and not a kiddie language.

## JavaScript's History

[Brendan Eich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich) is who invented JavaScript.

**JavaScript**, often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based, multi-paradigm, and interpreted programming language. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of World Wide Web content production. It is used to make webpages interactive and provide online programs, including video games. [See article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript).

Despite the different names that JavaScript historical was names such as LiveScript, JavaScript is actually ECMAScript, so the language is standardized by a community, unlike other languages such as PHP.

But the language itself is still referred to as JavaScript.

Since JavaScript is updated on yearly cycle, it's name is changed, such as :

ECMAScript (ES5 or ES6) and moving forward will be named ES2016 or ES2017.

### Three Pillars of Front End Web Development (HTML, CSS and JS)

JavaScript is one of the pillars of the three pillars that consist of technologies that make the web possible, along with HTML and CSS. However, unlike HTML and CSS which are **markup languages**, JavaScript is a **programming language**.


## The JavaScript Console

**Pro-tip** Use the Keyboard Shortcut Reference found [here](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/shortcuts) for Chrome Dev Tools.

On a Mac, use `cmd + option + J` to open the JavaScript console in Google Chrome Dev Tools.

Some advocate, such as Nick Morgan to use the console to test out JavaScript code snippets within the console.
