You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

Your response goes here!

* What new skills have you learned?
===================================

One of the new skills I just recently learned through the course was about file paths and how they determine the location of a resource so that it can be accessed. A file path can be external, such as on a web page or local.

* What has been easy?
=====================

The easiest aspect of this course so far has been being re-introduced to some of the commonly used HTML elements such as headers, paragraphs, anchor links, lists and images.

* What has been difficult?
==========================

The hardest aspect has been learning about how the browser exposes paths for files that can be accessed by a web browser. Also, using the correct elements to match the mock up document for the Lesson 04 project.

Not course related but also setting up a local repo for keeping track of downloaded class assets for in-class work.


* How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
* =========================

Have yet to need to use these but look forward to using them.
