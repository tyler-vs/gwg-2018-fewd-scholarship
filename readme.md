I was fortunate enough to be receive a Grow With Google Challenge Scholarship, this repository contains notes and examples from the course. Thank you Google and Udacity for such a great opportunity for me to take part of. As someone who is trying to get a foot hold into the tech industry as a front-end web developer, this course was of tremendous importance to me because I can follow the footsteps of a leader in technology and fell confident in the curriculum.

## About

Phase 2 content will be contained in the `phase-2` branch. The new repository structure aims to reflect the structure of the core curriculum. Since the second phase contains and expands upon some of the material from the first phase, you will see some of the first phase content repositioned to reflect the second phases curriculum structure.

## Installation

You can clone this repository or simply [download](https://github.com/tyler-vs/gwg-2018-fewd-scholarship/archive/master.zip).

### Udacity Google Chrome Extension

The course will evaluate your work and one way in which it does so is by using a web browser extension for the Google Chrome browser, it can be downloading here [download](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/udacity-front-end-feedbac/melpgahbngpgnbhhccnopmlmpbmdaeoi/related).

## Usage

Each lesson has it's own sub directory within the repository root directory. Also each lesson should be on it's own branch - when a lesson branch is complete it is merged back into the `master` branch, so it is important that code is working _before_ merging. Omitted lessons are usually projects which were likely completed within the Udacity platform online or had content related to setup.

## Contributing
