![Grow With Google Scholarship Badge](img/GrowWithGoogleDeveloperChallengeScholarship.png)

I was fortunate enough to be receive a Grow With Google Challenge Scholarship, this repository contains notes and examples from the course. Thank you Google and Udacity for such a great oppurtunity for me to take part of. As someone who is trying to get a foot hold into the tech industry as a front-end web developer, this course was of tremendous importance to me because I can follow the footsteps of a leader in technology and fell confident in the curriculum.

## Installation

You can clone the repo or simply [download](https://github.com/tyler-vs/gwg-2018-fewd-scholarship/archive/master.zip).

### Udacity Google Chrome Extension

The course will evaluate your work and one way in which it does so is by using a web browser exension for the Google Chrome browser, it can be downloading here [download](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/udacity-front-end-feedbac/melpgahbngpgnbhhccnopmlmpbmdaeoi/related).

## Usage

Each lesson has it's own sub directory within the repository root directory. Also each lesson should be on it's own branch - when a lesson branch is complete it is merged back into the `master` branch, so it is important that code is working _before_ merging. Omitted lessons are usually projects which were likely completed within the Udacity platform online or had content related to setup.

## Contributing
