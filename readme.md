# Udacity Google Scholarship

Work to accompany the Udacity-Google Scholarship for Winter 2018.

## Setup 

Each lesson has it's own sub directory within the main repository. Also each lesson should be on it's own branch - when a lesson branch is complete it is merged back into `master`. Omitted lessons are usually projects which were likely completed within the Udacity platform online.

[Install Udacity Google Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/udacity-front-end-feedbac/melpgahbngpgnbhhccnopmlmpbmdaeoi/related) to validate problem set work.
